Lending Club: introduction and how it works
peer to peer loans through online lending platform
1) risk assesment on borrowers, determine a credit rating and assign appropriate interest rates
2) investors earn monthly returns
LC provides an excellent machine learning case study

Goal of the project:
Can we determine an accurate way of using loan characteristics to predict which loans will be 
paid back in full and which will default?
1) predict loan_status: 
2) predict int_rate (by selecting relevant features)
See the bottom part

Data Preparation:
https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action
information on the loans issued by LC, feautres of the loan, features of the borrower
2007-2011, 2012-2013, 2014, 2015, ...quarterly + Data Dictionary
Features: annual_inc, int_rate, grade, subgrade, home_ownership, total_acc, loan_status, etc.

Based on our goal, define the label:
loan$loan_status:
"Charged Off", "Current", "Default", "Fully paid", "In Grace Period", "Late"
To consolidate 

Feature Engineering & Data Exploratory:
1) loan issued grouped by FICO scores (?)
2) loan issued grouped by grades
3) # of loan issued by years
4) total loan amount issued by states
5) relationship between FICO and LC scores (grades, subgrade)
   LC relies on the foundation of FICO's scores to assess the credit worthiness of potential borrowers.
   find linear relationship between FICO scores and LC's grade system
   Findings: 
   a). Grades D,E,F,G even C have very close distributions and medians
   b). LC earlier model used to rely on FICO score heavily and over the course of the years, 
    LC refined their credit models using the data that they started accumulating.

Exploration & Discovery of the predictive strength of each feature:
which bariables are good predictors, 
1) debt VS rates
2) homeowership VS LC grades, charge off rates
3) loan purpose (education, small business) VS LC grades, charge off rates
4) rates VS revolving balance and employment length
5) # of delinquencies over the past 2 years VS rates
6) # of opened and total number of accounts
7) DTI (Debt to Income ratio), the lower the better, 
   some impact on charge off probabilities, DTI VS LC grades
8) Public records VS charge off rates
9) Age of Credit history VS rates
10) Annual Income VS rates
11) Revolving utilization: higher revolving utilization means higher risk of default rates
12) Inquiries in the last 6 months VS rates
13) Geography relate to rates

Preliminary Conclusion:
LC's data is a great source of information on personal credit.
Need more in depth analyses:
1) geographical selection bias
2) careful with the implications of certain features when trying to extract correlation
3) the safe way to do fnancial services is to keep the segmentation down to a minimum 
   and let the mathematics of risk pooling look after us
4) be carefull with adverse selection

other GOALs:
1) Build a credit model and predict reliably default rates
2) Predict grade
