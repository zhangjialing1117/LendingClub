Lending Club: introduction and how it works
peer to peer loans through online lending platform
1) risk assesment on borrowers, determine a credit rating and assign appropriate interest rates
2) investors earn monthly returns
LC provides an excellent machine learning case study

1. Goal of the project:
Can we determine an accurate way of using loan characteristics to predict which loans will be 
paid back in full and which will default?
1) predict loan_status: 
2) predict int_rate (by selecting relevant features)
See the bottom part

2. Data Preparation:
# https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action, 2007-2011, 2012-2013, 2014, 2015, ...quarterly + Data Dictionary
# information on the loans issued by LC, feautres of the loan, features of the borrower

kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data. 
The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. 887379*74
Contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) 
and latest payment information. 
Features: annual_inc, int_rate, grade, subgrade, home_ownership, total_acc, loan_status, etc.

3. Based on our goal, we need to define the label:
1) predict loan_status:
loan$loan_status: "Charged Off", "Current", "Default", "Fully paid", "In Grace Period", "Late", "Issued"
"Charged Off": as loans that the lender has no reasonable hope of recovering money from
Different ways to determine the label: 
# Removed all the records that did not meet credit thresholds - these loans were not endorsed by Lending Club, 
# and so are less important for the sake of this model.
a) status in between, hard to predict, thus NOT CONSIDERTION THESE LOAN
loan2 <- subset(loan2, !loan_status %in% c('Current', 'Issued')) 
loan2$loan_status_binary <- with(loan2, ifelse(loan_status == 'Fully Paid', 1, 0))
b) remove all the "Late" loans, as these fall into a certain grey area with ambiguous, undetermined final statuses.
c) combined the “Default” loans with the “Charged Off” loans 
Thus, the two final labels for classification attemps are: "Fully Paid" & "Charged Off (included "Default")
2) predict int_rates

#### Further cleaning of the data involved conerting interest rates and revolving utility rates from factors to numerics, 
removing empty factor levels, and removing annual income outliers.

4. Feature Engineering:
several features of the data set were inherently related, 
1) open_acc, total_acc -> create a feature: current_account_ratio (open_acc divided by total_acc)
2) loan_issue_date, the date of the borrorwer's first credit line -> calculate the length of each borrow's credit history

5. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploration & Discovery of the predictive strength of each feature:
which bariables are good predictors, 
# 1) loan issued grouped by FICO scores
# 2) loan issued grouped by grades
# 3) # of loan issued by years
# 4) total loan amount issued by states
# 5) relationship between FICO and LC scores (grades, subgrade)
   LC relies on the foundation of FICO's scores to assess the credit worthiness of potential borrowers.
   find linear relationship between FICO scores and LC's grade system
   Findings: 
   a). Grades D,E,F,G even C have very close distributions and medians
   b). LC earlier model used to rely on FICO score heavily and over the course of the years, 
    LC refined their credit models using the data that they started accumulating.
    
(1) numeri features: histograms, segmented out by loan outcome
(2) categorical features: table,
(3) multivariate explorations

1) debt VS rates
2) homeowership VS LC grades, charge off rates
3) loan purpose (education, small business) VS LC grades, charge off rates
4) rates VS revolving balance and employment length
5) # of delinquencies over the past 2 years VS rates
6) # of opened and total number of accounts
7) DTI (Debt to Income ratio), the lower the better, 
   some impact on charge off probabilities, DTI VS LC grades
8) Public records VS charge off rates
9) Age of Credit history VS rates
10) Annual Income VS rates
11) Revolving utilization: higher revolving utilization means higher risk of default rates
12) Inquiries in the last 6 months VS rates
13) Geography relate to rates

14) loan_status VS int_rate (intuition sense: as higher int_rate are assigned to risker investments)
15) loan_status VS grade
16)


Preliminary Conclusion:
LC's data is a great source of information on personal credit.
Need more in depth analyses:
1) geographical selection bias
2) careful with the implications of certain features when trying to extract correlation
3) the safe way to do fnancial services is to keep the segmentation down to a minimum 
   and let the mathematics of risk pooling look after us
4) be carefull with adverse selection

6. Build models
1) Decision Tree
2) 

other GOALs:
1) Build a credit model and predict reliably default rates
2) Predict grade
